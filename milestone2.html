  <h1 class="page-header">Prototyping Overview</h1>
  <p class="lead">After receiving feedback from Jofish and John during class on Thursday, April 17, we reassessed our originally proposed ideas from Milestone 1 in a second brainstorming session. Since most of our initial ideas were not viable as final project ideas, we came up with two new ideas with a focus on the social dynamics in MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). In particular, we are interested in understanding and improving the ways in which students and instructors can interact with one another through videoconferencing software like Google Hangouts, and how the affordances of that platform can improve the learning experience between distributed peers. In addition to the two new MOOC/Hangout focused ideas, we iterated upon one of our originally proposed ideas on sensing availability and contacting friends.</p>
