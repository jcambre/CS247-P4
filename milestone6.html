  <h3 class="page-header">Changes since our last functional prototype</h3>
  <p class="lead">Since Milestone 4, we've made several significant changes to our prototype.<br/>Each change is featured below.</p>

  <ul id="prototype-changes">
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>Warn users that the instructor can monitor their behavior at all times, and that they can be seen/heard during the Think phase
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>As part of the feedback we received from Milestone 5, John was particularly concerned with user privacy regarding whether participants knew they were visible during the Think/Pair phases of the discussion. Though participants were informed of this verbally prior to participating in the user study, we wanted the same information to be communicated in the interface by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>Improve instructions for Think-Pair-Share activity phases so students know what to expect before discussion begins
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>During user testing it wasn't clear what students should expect from the various stages of Think-Pair-Share. Explaining the activity required the instructor to recite from a script prior to each study session. We wanted the activity to be more readily understandable from within the interface itself, without direct instructor involvement, and fleshed out our instructions accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>Extend time for the pair phase (now set to 120 seconds by default, twice what it was before)
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>In our user studies, we found that participants were consistently unsatisfied with the length of time provided for the Pair phase of the discussion, in which each participant speaks individually with one other participant. Previously, the Pair phase was set at 60 seconds, but users had a difficult time introducing themselves and switching off in sharing their perspectives in a balanced way during this allotted time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Highlighting of time remaining - <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow;">New feature!</span>
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        We've improved the interface to look less prototypey and more professional. Additionally we've adjusted the countdown timer to glow red when nearing the end of each phase. In testing, users complained that they were taken by surprise when the interface changed phases of TPS. We hope that this change, though subtle, will make it clearer to users what exactly is going on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Instructor "intercom" - <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow;">New feature!</span>
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        We have added the ability for the instructor to communicate with students during the Pair phase by enabling/disabling the "intercom" button. This allows greater transparency and finer control/granularity in interaction with the group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Instructor's graph now supports an arbitrary number of students
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        Originally this was a pre-set number and our graph was statically generated. Now the Highcharts API call is inside a wrapper function that allows us to set style attributes and the number of users dynamically. This is half of the functionality needed to support arbitrary numbers of students in a group discussion (last week we could only support four).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Dynamic rather than pre-defined thresholds to trigger alerts - <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow;">New feature!</span>
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        Thresholds for high or low user participation are now dependent on the total number of users in the Hangout, and adjusted thresholds are reflected in the instructor's graph and in the logic that triggers notifications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Notifications are now only triggered once every 30 seconds and under instructor review
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        User testing indicated that users disliked receiving constant notifications and desired spacing-out between these alerts. Additionally, we have routed all notifications to come from the instructor rather than the app itself, meaning that while not yet implemented, instructors will soon be able to approve/deny notificatons sent to particular users and to initiate new ones. This also makes it clearer where the notifcations are coming from (a common complaint during testing).
      </li>

  </ul>

    <p class="lead">Next steps</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finalize support for arbitrary numbers of participants.</li>
      <li>Allow an arbitrary participant to serve as the instructor during discussion (first to claim it? first to join the Hangout?).</li>
      <li>Edge cases: Handle what happens when participants drop out or join mid-discussion.</li>
      <li>Allow instructor over-ride control in moving on to the next phase once she feels that pairs she has observed have discussed the prompt sufficiently. Conversely, give the instructor the ability to arbitrarily extend the time left in each phase.</li>
      <li>Support a reestart of the whole Think-Pair-Share discussion process. Right now we need to begin a new Hangout to reset.</li>
      <li>Allow instructors to input an arbitrary prompt rather than a pre-defined one.</li>
      <li>Provide information on participants (location, local time, local weather etc.) to help in setting the context for getting acquainted, especially for pairs.</li>
    </ul>
