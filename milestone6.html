  <h3 class="page-header">Changes since our last functional prototype</h3>
  <p class="lead">Since Milestone 4, we have made several significant changes to our prototype.<br/>Each change is featured below:</p>

  <ul id="prototype-changes">
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>Warn users that the instructor can monitor their behavior at all times, and that they can be seen/heard during the think phase.<br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>As part of the feedback we received from Milestone 5, John was particularly concerned with user privacy regarding whether participants knew they were visible during the Think/Pair phases of the discussion. Though participants were informed of this verbally prior to participating in the user study, we wanted the same information to be communicated in the interface by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>Improve instructions for Think-Pair-Share activity phases so students know what to expect before the discussion begins.<br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>During user testing it wasn't clear what students should expect from the various stages of Think-Pair-Share. Explaining the activity required the instructor to recite from a script prior to each study session. We wanted the activity to be more readily understandable from within the interface itself, without direct instructor involvement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>Extend time for the pair phase (now set to 120 seconds by default, twice what it was before).<br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>In our user studies, we found that participants were consistently unsatisfied with the length of time provided for the "Pair" phase of the discussion, in which each participant speaks individually with one other participant. Previously, the Pair phase was set at 60 seconds, but users had a difficult time introducing themselves and switching off in sharing their perspectives in a balanced way during this allotted time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Interface clean-up and highlighting of remaining time.
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        We're improved the interface to look less prototypey and more professional. Additionally we're adjusted the countdown timer to glow red when nearing the end. In testing users complained that they were taken by surprised by the interface changed over to the next phase of Think-Pair-Share. We hope that this change, though subtle, will make it clearer to users what exactly is going on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Instructor's graph now supports an arbitrary number of students
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        Originally this was a pre-set number and our graph was statically generated. Now the Highcharts API call is inside a wrapper function that allows us to set style attributes and the number of users dynamically. This is half of the functionality needed to support arbitrary numbers of students in a group discussion (last week we could only support four).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Dynamic rather than pre-defined thresholds to trigger alerts
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        Thresholds for high or low participation are now dependent on the number of users in the Hangout, and adjusted thresholds are reflected in the instructor's graph and in the logic that triggers a notification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change: </strong>
        Notifications only triggered once every 30 seconds and are under instructor control
        <br/>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        User testing indicated that users disliked receiving constant notifications and desired spacing between these alerts. We have also routed all notifications to come from the instructor rather than the app itself, meaning that while not yet implemented, instructors will soon be able to approve/deny notificaitons sent to particular users and initiate new ones. Further user testing we will examine how best to address this interface.
