  <h3 class="page-header">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="lead">We have decided to combine the features of fully functional prototypes 1 and 2 in order to create a "suite" of teaching tools for use in MOOCs (Mass Open Online Courses). This suite will initially include two major features: (1) conversational cues to balance discussion and (2) break-out groups in line with the pedagogical technique of Think-Pair-Share. Our theoretical usage case is in a professor or teaching assistant holding "office hours" over Google Hangouts or in students getting together for an informal study session.</p>
  <p>To prepare for this user study, we have adjusted our second prototype, hiding the graph by default and adding in popover alert-style cues to notify users if they have gone above or beyond a verbal contribution threshold. We envision this new layout and notification system to be less visually districating and cause less psychogically stress--two common complaints during testing. Break-out groups will stay as is, but we wll add some additional features to allow instructors to control the size of these groups and the delay time between Think and Pair.</p>
  <p>When running this study we plan to gauge whether our features are useful, whether the interface is intuitive, whether the graph is dechipherable (we may run AB testing with an alternative type of graph), if the trasition from Pair to Share is too abrupt, whether the contribution cues are too noticeable, and vice versa. This will allow us to adjust our prototype in preparation for Functional Prototype II.</p>
