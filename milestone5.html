  <h1 class="page-header">Milestone 5: User Study</h1>

  <h3 class="page-header">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="lead">We have decided to combine the features of fully functional prototypes 1 and 2 in order to create a "suite" of teaching tools for use in MOOCs (Mass Open Online Courses). This suite will initially include two major features: (1) conversational cues to balance discussion and (2) break-out groups in line with the pedagogical technique of Think-Pair-Share. Our theoretical usage case is in a professor or teaching assistant holding "office hours" over Google Hangouts or in students getting together for an informal study session.</p>
  <p>To prepare for this user study, we have adjusted our second prototype, hiding the graph by default and adding in popover alert-style cues to notify users if they have gone above or beyond a verbal contribution threshold. We envision this new layout and notification system to be less visually districating and stresful--two common complaints during our previous testing. Break-out groups will stay as is.</p>
  <p>When running this study we plan to gauge whether our features are useful, whether the interface is intuitive, if the trasition from Pair to Share is too abrupt, whether the contribution cues are noticeable and frequent enough, etc. This will allow us to adjust our prototype between user trials and in preparation for Functional Prototype II.</p>

  <h3 class="page-header">Methods</h3>
  <dl>
    <b>Study design</b>
    <p>We will run four users--two random Stanford students, two confederates (ourselves) through a Google Hangout with one of us (a fifth user) acting as instructor. Users will be recruited through Piazza or through mutual friends. We plan to run four sessions, each with two users who have never before seen our app.</p>
    <b>Study setup</b>
    <p>Users will be invited to join the group Hangout, remotely, and asking to load our app. Then they will listen to a brief, scripted 30 second introduction from the "instructor" on what they will be doing during the discussion. The instructor will then press a button visible to only her and all users except the instructor will enter the Think phase of Think-Pair-Share. For 30 seconds users will see only themselves and reflect individually on a text prompt with a discussion question displayed within the Hangout app. Immediately after this time has exhausted, each user will be randomly Paired up with another user (hence why we needed four users--an even number with two pairs). For 60 seconds they will only see/hear the video/audio feed of their partner. Pairs will be instructed by another text prompt to together discuss the proposed question. During this time, all users (and their paired conversations) will be visible to the instructor. Afterwards all users will return to the group to Share their solutions. Before participants are asked to begin sharing, the instructor will trigger the discussion-balancing mechanism. Only the instructor will have access to the graph with each users' verbal contributions. However, users will individually and discreetly be notified by alert-style popovers if they speak above or below a conversational threshold. We will set these thresholds to be relatively minor such that they are commonly triggered by users and we can then measure user feedback. After 3 minutes or so and the conversation has died down, the instructor will end the Google Hangout. Each of the two users will be interviewed individually by a confederate and asked the following series of scripted questions--</p>

    <b>Survey Questions</b><br/>
    <p>Please answer the following:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>When the discussion began, what did you expect to happen when the instructor said you would be breaking into groups? How well did this process of separation match with what you expected?</li>
      <li>Please describe interaction with your partner during the "Pair" phase of the discussion? Did you immediately address the question, spend some time introducing yourselves, etc.?</li>
      <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, please rank how appropriate you felt the length of each phase of the conversation was, where 1 = way too short and 10 = way too long:
        <ol>
          <li>Think phase</li>
          <li>Pair phase</li>
          <li>Share phase</li>
        </ol></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you received a notification during the discussion for high or low participation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>When the notification appeared, what did you think was going on?</li>
        <li>When the notification appeared, how did it affect your participation for the rest of the discussion? Did the notification confuse you? Was it immediately visible?</li>
        <li>In the moments leading up to when the notification appeared, where you conscious of your participation level relative to everyone else's? If so, how would you describe your own level of participation in that moment?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Additional questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What do you think could use the most improvement?</li>
          <li>What did you like the most about this experience?</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <h4>Observations from <b>User Trial 1:</b></h4>
        <p>&nbsp;User 1.1: Mitchell</p>
          <ul>
            <li>pretty self-explanatory, the crossed off images helped explained</li>
            <li>kinda weird having this last for "50 seconds"</li>
            <li>oh we have 20 seconds left to talk, you don't usually have a time limit, the instructor just butts</li>
            <li>what if instructor could manually trigger</li>
            <li>think-6.5, pair-4, share-5</li>
            <li>notifcation: I was kind of annoyed because there was a lot of beeping</li>
            <li>one beep would be better</li>
            <li>it was a small group, it happened way too quickly</li>
            <li>maybe not beep or alert when someone is in the middle of talking</li>
            <li>valid alert but just too quickly.. it came up before 1 person had finished saying what their favorite class was</li>
            <li>most improvement: the timing on stuff</li>
            <li>"I think it's a pretty cool feature and it's interesting to me that they don't already have it."</li>

      <h4>Observations from <b>User Trial 2:</b></h4>
        <p>&nbsp;User 2.1: Anh</p>
          <ul>
            <li>thought there would be more of a transition, it was really abrupt, how about a warning screen right before you cut out everyone</li>
            <li>I didn't like the cut off, moving too quickly</li>
            <li>pair - we didn't start by talking about the topic, we started with small talk</li>
            <li>I'm not sure what the purpose of the app is, but when you give people a question to answer that is somewhat random you should establish a mutual interest, less natural discussion</li>
            <li>GIVEN THE SCOPE (I told her the purpose of the app) - in a classroom setting I am far less likely to small talk</li>
            <li>What is the point??</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to get more comfortable with my partner first</li>
            <li>think-6 (it depends on the question, I can think into more detail), pair-2, share-5 with random distractions</li>
            <li>let the instructor set the time for different questions</li>
            <li>what did you think was going on?</li>
            <li>at first I didn't notice it, took a while to register that the beeps meant I should stop talking</li>
            <li>the STOP talking made me stop talking,the START was timed poorly cuz I didn't want to talk over someone else when they were already speaking</li>
            <li>definitely MORE CONSCIOUS AFTER</li>
            <li>set up a really good evnironment for discussion</li>
            <li>timing and beeping weird, and direction could be clearer. people kept getting cut off? wasted time on small talk without knowing objective</li>
          </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;User 2.2: Ian</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pair interaction: I thought it was going to be awkward because I was randomly paired up with someone, but I was surprised that it felt very natural. It reminded me of when you're in a classroom and your teacher randomly pairs you up and you just start talking.</li>
            <li>Think-pair-share lengths: Think=5, Pair=2 (it was way too short, it should've been double the length because one of us talked for the whole time and the other just talked for a few seconds), Share=5</li>
            <li>I thought it would've been helpful if the system prompted us to switch off to give the other person a chance to speak during the pair phase (similar to what an instructor does in the classroom)</li>
            <li>Notifications: Yeah the notification I got was really rude, it hurt my feelings. It told me to stop talking and I wanted to cry. It made me feel like my input didn't matter, and it felt like someone was yelling at me.</li>
            <li>How did it impact your participation after receiving the notifcation: I didn't talk anymore, at all. I felt like I wasn't valued.</li>
            <li>Did you have any sense of where the indication came from/why it was triggered?  -- "I thought the moderator manually typed it, I didn't realize it was auto-generated."</li>
          </ul>
      <h4>Observations from <b>User Trial 3:</b></h4>
        <p>&nbsp;User 3.1: Alex</p>
          <ul>
            <li>when it happened I thought I was being stupid and missed it or something
            <li>when it switched it would have been nice if it changed and then showed you the video, there should be sequencing</li>
            <li>partner interaction was great, enjoyable, group discussion got better since people had connected better with their partners, easier to remember</li>
            <li>got back into group, spaced out, should be more direction in the share phase? people shouldn't have talked about their partners. more passionate and interesting; just cuz it's tradition in section to prove that you listened to your partner</li>
            <li>think-8, pair-5, share-5</li>
            <li>like- random pairing is cool</li>
            <li>improve- experience of all getting back together, prompting people early in the share experience to talk, sequentially, send notification direction to someone to talk</li>
          </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;User 3.2: Harley</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pair Interaction: It was when I was just with the partmer it was easier to have a proper conversation because you weren't talking all over each other</li>
            <li>There was an introductory, "whats up i know you're in the other room how's it going" I think it'll happen even it's the first time we've met since it's human decency</li>
            <li>we had time </li>
            <li>It was kinda one sided, i answered the question but by the time I was like "yo dude what about you" we were almost out of time</li>
            <li>When we came back as a room, there was a moment when everyone was silent because no one knew who wanted to speak first. Unclear whehter we had all seen the same prompts. I assumed that we had, but it wasn't totally clear. There was no thing that everyone else had said the same prompt. I think there needed to be a conversation leader. I wish someone had prompted one of us to start -- made it quicker to get into the real conversation</li>
            <li>I definitely think it was more productive than having a free-for all than with a typical video chat and someone else cutting them off. Having a one on one interaction. Gave them real conversation topics to talk about.</li>
            <li>Think phase: Thinking time: 5 -- just perfect. If it were a longer talk</li>
            <li>Discussion: A little short, needed more time to hit his answer and I was watching the clock tick down and I need to start wrapping up so I don't use the whole time</li>
            <li>Share: Last part was untimed, I was assuming that was fine. It was up to us when to leave and we could've had it decided upon but what if it was still going</li>
            <li>I think you should change the icon you have when you're hiding the other people -- that's a small thing. Have their profile picture but greyed out.</li>
            <li>I like the idea that you could have this conversation with this single person and then it brings it back. Improved the quality of the discussion pretty significantly.</li>
            <li>There did need to be more leadership.</li>
          </ul>
      <h4>Observations from <b>User Trial 4:</b></h4>
        <p>&nbsp;User 4.1: Katie</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I was still saying something when the conversation switched back</li>
          <li>I dont know how it would've gone if I was paired with billy</li>
          <li>Think pair share time lengths: I think we took too much time to set up, but since it's the first time we did that it's not that surprising</li>
          <li>I know sometimes a teacher wants to give an additional detail during the discussion time, so you might want the instructor to be able to provide a little hint.</li>
          <li>Improvement: Dyes/paints get on the walls.</li>
          <li>I'm wondering how you know how throughout the course, some people ahve a buddy they really like to discuss with, maybe I'd like to specifically be sure that I'm paired up with Kyle or something?</li>
          <li>I really liked the one on one, because when you have so many other people it's so easy to tune out and just watch everything happen, but having a one on one really fores you to particpate and engage with one another</li>
        </uL>
        <p>&nbsp;User 4.2: Will</p>
        <ul>
<li>I had no idea the teacher was in charge</li>
<li>timer worked well, could look a lot better, testing for functionality</li>
<li>time is short - you want to know the guy on the other end , not enough time</li>
<li>pair - introduced for first half,</li>
<li>think-5 (dependent on the question), pair-3, share-5</li>
<li>notification - unprofessional, obnoxious, contributed negatively
reset time wasn't quick enough! hide notification for a while
sound only the first time</li>
<li>aware that "this computer" was monopolizing discussion</li>
<li>the fun factor of being around cool people, cool to use a tool that was created, using Hangouts for something greater than skype</li>
<li>I can see it being used for an online discussion section </li>
<li>useful from perspection</li>
<li>you should test in a real environment, take over 161 office hours</li>
<li>more aggressive interface? gradually make the screen smaller</li>

        </ul>
