<h3 class="page-header">Try it out</h3>
<p class="lead">To test our functional prototype, have one participant initiate a Hangout using the green button below. From within that Hangout, the tester should then invite <b>3 additional participants</b> to join in the conversation. Once all 4 individuals are in the Hangout, click the "Start Discussion" button on the left-hand panel, and begin speaking. Throughout the conversation, keep tabs on how much each person has contributed to the discussion through the Discussion Metrics graph on the left.</p>

<h3 class="page-header">Features</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Simple Hangout initiation</dt>
  <dd>In order to make it easier to test our functional prototype, we integrated an "Instant Hangout" button within this page to initiate a discussion. Any Hangout launched from this page will load with our custom Hangout app within it automatically, which eases the setup burden on participants. Implementing the Instant Hangout button also required that we make the app public, which consequently allows for anyone to use the app rather than just the development team.</dd>

  <dt>Indicator for number of remaining participants necessary before a discussion can begin</dt>
  <dd>For the purposes of our functional prototype, we needed to simplify the implementation a bit and impose a strict number of participants present in a discussion at a given time. Since we require that there be 4 participants total, the system will display to the local participant how many additional participants are needed in order to initiate a conversation. This gives users an understanding of why the interface is rather limited as others are initially joining the Hangout.</dd>

  <dt>Live graph indications for participation metrics</dt>
  <dd>Building on our Wizard of Oz prototype from Milestone 3, we created a live, conversational cue indicator to give participants in a Google Hangout immediate feedback about relative speaking times in a group conversation. Of the two indicators that we tested, we selected one to integrate as part of a custom Google Hangout app. In a left-hand panel next to the main video feed, we show participants a dynamic bar graph with four columns, one for each participant in the group. Each participant's column is automatically labeled with their name. As the conversation progresses, the bars will automatically re-weight to indicate the changing distribution of the conversation. While the WoZ test relied upon a wizard to manually log the speaking time for each participant, our prototype leverages the default Hangouts behavior which automatically switches the video feed to focus on whichever participant is currently speaking. Using the Hangouts API to track these camera feed event changes, we compute how long each participant spoke on a given turn, and use that information to generate the conversation distribution.</dd>

  <dt>Synchronized start/stop buttons across all instances of the Hangout App to control participation tracking</dt>
  <dd>The live graph indicator introduced above relies upon a single Firebase instance on the backend to keep track of discussion participation distribution. Since we only wanted to display participation indicators once <i>all</i> participants had arrived and were ready to chat, we allow the discussion participants to determine exactly when their discussion really starts and stops to avoid skewing the statistics based on pre-meeting chatter. This ability to initiate the discussion only appears once there are 4 participants present in the discussion. Any participant can start or stop the discussion, and these controls are shared across all instances of the app. Any time one person clicks to start or stop the discussion, that action will be reflected on everyone else's app as well.</dd>

  <dt>Show/Hide the left-hand panel with the discussion graph</dt>
  <dd>In response to feedback we gathered during Wizard of Oz testing and M3 evaluation, we decided to allow users to hide the discussion participation graph within the app interface. During user testing, participants voiced discomfort with the prominence of the graph in displaying information about their performance, and signaled that they would prefer to have the graph visible only on-demand so that it did not distract significantly from the conersation. To that end, we allow participants to toggle the visibility of the discussion graph panel; when hidden, the interface looks almost identical to a normal Hangout app.</dd>

<h3 class="page-header">Implementation</h3>
<span>The github reposity for this milestone can be found <a href="https://github.com/jcambre/CS247-P4/tree/moderator">here.</a> Implementation progress can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/jcambre/CS247-P4/commits/moderator">here.</a> Unfortunately we've found no better way to test changes to our code than in actually running live instances of Hangout, so we push often and even for debugging purposes.</a></span>
<ul>
  <li><b>app.xml</b> - Originally adopted from Talkabout (see Additional Notes below), this file implements the Hangout app. It employs the Google Hangouts API to intitiate an interface when the hangout has fully loaded and readies the callback functions defined in <i>turn-taking.js</i>.</li>
  <li><b>firebase_setup.js</b> - This file is reserved for future implementation, specifically in initializing multiple instances of Firebase (we currently employ only one instance on the backend, which we reset manually).</li>
  <li><b>style.css</b> - Contains the CSS rules for our Hangouts app, including the size and orientation of the interface. Also includes override rules for styling the Highcharts graph we use to display user activity.</li>
  <li><b>turn-taking.js</b> - This file currently contains the bulk of our implementation. Here we initiate and connect to Firebase, declare all local and global variables, and define the callbacks for use in <i>app.xml</i>. The <i>init()</i> function sets up the app, getting participant information (IDs, etc.) and listens for turn reporting. Turn reporting listens for calls to the Hangouts API function <i>gapi.hangout.layout.getDefaultVideoFeed().onDisplayedParticipantChanged()</i> and updates the Firebase backend accordingly to reflect who is currently speaking. Because the displayed participant will never be the currently active local user, we must have 3 or more users reporting who is currently displayed (this is the user who is on display for all but one of those other participants). We periodically update the data content of the Highcharts graph by pulling from Firebase on a <i>setTimer()</i> function. Chart creation logic is also here, at least temporarily, as the Highcharts API has a strict requirements for which properties to include when initiating instances of a chart/graph.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="page-header">Next Steps: Looking Ahead to User Testing</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Support an arbitrary number of participants in a discussion, rather than limiting it to 4.</li>
  <li>Gracefully handle the situation in which participants join or drop out of the discussion in the middle of a conversation.</li>
  <li>Thoughtfully decide upon what constitutes as "acceptable" discussion behavior, and where the extremes for low and high participation on the graph should be set. This will likely involve widening the middle region to allow for a wider variance in participation levels.</li>
  <li>Display automated, private notifications to users who cross into the "extreme" regions of low or high participation to discretely prompt them to speak up or quiet down.</li>
  <li>Design and implement an alternative visualization for the same participation metric information, which will serve as an alternative interface for the purposes of A/B testing in use studies.</li>
  <li>Improve the process of entering a Hangout together as a group. If possible, we'd like to allow everyone to enter a Hangout through the <a href="https://github.com/google/instant-hangouts">Instant Hangout widget</a>, which creates one "always open" Hangout room for anyone to join from a particular page, without needing to be invited. However, it seems that the feature is not yet publicly supported.</li>
  <li>Support multiple discussions being held concurrently. This means initiliating multiple instances of Firebase. This is required as our app is now public and this is scenario is likely to occur.</li>
  <li>Fix bugs related to hiding and re-opening the interface.</li>
  <li>Make the interface pixel-perfect!</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="page-header">Additional Notes</h3>
	A small portion of the code which served as the building blocks for our Google Hangout app was drawn from previous work by team member Julia Cambre on Talkabout, an (almost-but-not-quite) open-source platform for small-group discussions in MOOCs. In particular, this included some layout logic and components of our automated turn-taking detection. Any code derived from her work is attributed within the comments. Additionally, we are using the <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts API</a> to create our dynamic graph.
