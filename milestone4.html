<h3 class="page-header">Try it out</h1>
<p class="lead">To test our functional prototype, have one participant initiate a Hangout using the green button below. From within that Hangout, the tester should then invite <b>3 additional participants</b> to join in the conversation. Once all 4 individuals are in the Hangout, click the "Start Discussion" button on the left-hand panel, and begin speaking. Throughout the conversation, keep tabs on how much each person has contributed to the discussion through the Discussion Metrics graph on the left.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Simple Hangout initiation</dt>
  <dd>Launching a Hangout directly from this webpage, rather than having to manually create one and find the app. Also made the app public.</dd>
  <dt>Indicator for number of remaining participants necessary to begin a discussion</dt>
  <dd>...</dd>

  <dt>Synchronized start/stop buttons across all instances of the Hangout App to control participation tracking</dt>
  <dd>...</dd>

  <dt>Live graph indications for participation metrics</dt>
  <dd>...</dd>

  <dt>Show/Hide the left-hand panel with the discussion graph</dt>
  <dd>(This was in response to users voicing discomfort with the prominence of the interface during our WoZ testing... They can hide it and pretend it's just a normal hangout going on and eventually, the only interruption they will receive is if they end up in either of the "extreme" categories for low or high participation)</dd>

<h3 class="page-header">Implementation Progress</h1>

<h3 class="page-header">Next Steps: Looking Ahead to User Testing</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Support an arbitrary number of participants in a discussion, rather than limiting it to 4.</li>
  <li>Gracefully handle the situation in which participants join or drop out of the discussion in the middle of a conversation.</li>
  <li>Thoughtfully decide upon what constitutes as "acceptable" discussion behavior, and where the extremes for low and high participation on the graph should be set.</li>
  <li>Display automated private notifications to users who cross into the "extreme" regions of low or high participation to discretely prompt them to speak up or quiet down.</li>
  <li>Design and implement an alternative visualization for the same discussion metric information, which will serve as an alternative for the purposes of A/B testing in use studies.</li>
  <li>Make the interface pixel-perfect!</li>
</ol>
